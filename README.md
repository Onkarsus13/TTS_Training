TTS is a library for advanced Text-to-Speech generation. It's built on the latest research, was designed to achieve the best trade-off among ease-of-training, speed and quality.
TTS comes with pretrained models, tools for measuring dataset quality and already used in **20+ languages** for products and research projects.


- Efficient, flexible, lightweight but feature complete `Trainer API`.
- Released and ready-to-use models.
- Tools to curate Text2Speech datasets under```dataset_analysis```.
- Utilities to use and test your models.
- Modular (but not too much) code base enabling easy implementation of new ideas.

## Install TTS
TTS is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with **python >= 3.7, < 3.11.**.

If you plan to code or train models, clone 🐸TTS and install it locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS
pip install -e .[all,dev,notebooks]  # Select the relevant extras
```
